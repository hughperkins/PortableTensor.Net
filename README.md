# PortableTensor.Net
Cross-platform Tensor with transpose, slice as views over underlying data

Example usage, see [TestTensor.cs](TestTensor.cs).

# Comparison to other projects:

- [NumSharp](https://github.com/SciSharp/NumSharp) is weakly typed. There is a very limited Generics support, but missing the functions I need
- [Tensor.Net](https://github.com/SciSharp/Tensor.NET) Uses native C++, so does not run on my Mac, not cross-platform
